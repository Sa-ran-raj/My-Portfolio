## 📬 Contact Form with Nodemailer

The contact form collects name, email, subject, and message, and sends it using a **Nodemailer-powered backend**. This backend is typically deployed on platforms like **Render**, **Railway**, or **Vercel Functions**.

> ⚠️ For security reasons, the backend is not included in this repository. If you’d like to see or reuse the Nodemailer setup, feel free to contact me.
